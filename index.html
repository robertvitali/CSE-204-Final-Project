          <p id = "governmentTEXT">Nearly every state has a cover crop program endorsed by that respective state’s government. This is primarily because everyone benefits from the implementation of cover crops. In the long run, farmers save money because they don’t need to purchase fertilizer, it better replenishes nutrients deep in the soil and cover crops are also known to increase crop yield over time. State governments are incentivized because they save money from decreased erosion, costing the U.S. $44 billion dollars annually. The graphic is depicts a tool created by Cornell University for farmers in New York to narrow down the types of cover-crops they can grow based on their acreage, growing season, and location.

Outlined in the data graphic is the economics behind his choice to plant exclusively cover-crops since 1991. It is important to note Rulon has not tilled his land since 1991, yet his fall 2017 ROI is above 250%. Most impressively, his crops showed tremendous drought-resistance. In 2013, Rulon’s corn planted after cover crops yielded 30 more bushels per acre than those planted without cover crops. If you would like to learn more click on the graphic to be redirected.</p>
